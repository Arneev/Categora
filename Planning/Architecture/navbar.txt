Add Categories

	We ask ourselves the question, do we combined the view categories and add categories with an option to add another category
	OR do we keep them seperate, 

	Assuming sepeartion,

		Pros:
			- Clean Look
			- De-coupling functionality from UI, cleaner code

		Cons:
			- An extra page to go to 

	Only one field which is the category name for the adding of a category, 
	this seems like too much just for adding a category, 

	Even with the cleaner look and de-coupling, it makes more sense to have
	the create category button in the view Categories.

	Tasks with no due dates go at the end
